// Marked `code` renderer override that gives every non-mermaid fenced
// block a copy control in its top-right corner. The click behaviour is
// NOT here — `codeCopyClipboard.ts` installs one delegated listener for
// the whole document. This file stays pure (marked + the zero-dep
// `@mulmoclaude/common` leaf) so tests can assert the html shape without
// a browser.
//
// Why the renderer and not a post-render DOM scan (the shape
// `useMermaidRenderer` uses): a viewer's `renderedHtml` is a computed
// over streaming text, so `v-html` replaces the container's innerHTML on
// every chunk. A scan-and-attach pass would re-insert a button into every
// block on every chunk, and an "already attached" marker cannot prevent
// it because the nodes it marked are gone after the next patch. Markup
// emitted here rides along in the string Vue already writes.
//
// Why the button floats over a wrapper instead of sitting in a header
// strip above the block: `pre` is styled by UNLAYERED css in at least
// three places (`.markdown-content pre` in `src/index.css`, plus scoped
// `:deep(pre)` in textResponse's and skill's Views). Unlayered rules beat
// Tailwind's `@layer utilities` outright, so a utility on the `pre` could
// not flatten its bottom corners — a header strip would mean editing the
// global stylesheet in two packages. A wrapper the existing selectors do
// not name collides with none of it. The button lives on the WRAPPER, not
// inside the `pre`, so it stays put when a wide block scrolls sideways.
//
// Registration order (see setup.ts): AFTER `markedHighlightExtension`,
// BEFORE `mermaidExtension`. Later `.use()` calls wrap earlier ones, so
// mermaid ends up outermost and a `mermaid` fence short-circuits into its
// placeholder without reaching this wrapper; every other fence falls
// through to here. Registering after highlight is what lets us emit the
// finished block: highlight's `walkTokens` has already rewritten
// `token.text` to highlighted html and stamped `token.escaped`.

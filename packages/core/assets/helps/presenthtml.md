# presentHtml — Authoring Guide

Reference for the `presentHtml` plugin. The HTML you provide is saved to `artifacts/html/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>-<timestamp>.html` and rendered in the canvas. The user may also open the file directly from disk via `file://`, so it must remain portable: every URL inside the document has to resolve both when served by the app and when loaded straight off the filesystem.

## Two ways to call it: `html` vs `path`

`presentHtml` accepts **either** `html` **or** `path` (not both):

- **`html`** — a complete self-contained document. The host saves it to a fresh `artifacts/html/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>-<timestamp>.html` and presents it. The response's `data.filePath` is the saved path — capture it if you need to store a reference.
- **`path`** — the workspace-relative path of an HTML file you **already wrote** under `artifacts/html/…`. The host presents that existing page **without re-saving a copy**. Use this for pages you authored directly on disk with the `Write` tool (e.g. a pre-built lesson), so presenting them later doesn't duplicate the file. The path must end in `.html` and live under `artifacts/html/`.

Saving (with `html`) also renders in the user's canvas, so do **not** loop it to batch-create many pages quietly — write those directly to disk and present them on demand with `path`.

## Self-Contained Document

- Full document including `<!DOCTYPE html>` and `<html>` / `<body>` tags.
- All CSS and JavaScript inline, or loaded via a public CDN. No local script / stylesheet files (the app does not host arbitrary `.css` / `.js`).

### Allowed CDNs

The preview iframe enforces a CSP that only permits a curated set of CDNs. **Use these origins or your script / stylesheet will be silently blocked** and the page will render broken (e.g. `Plotly is not defined` if the chart library was blocked):

- `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` — broadest coverage; preferred for any npm-shaped library
- `https://unpkg.com` — same scope as jsdelivr; fallback
- `https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com` — curated mirror; common for older libraries
- `https://fonts.googleapis.com` + `https://fonts.gstatic.com` — Google Fonts
- `https://cdn.plot.ly` — Plotly's first-party CDN (also reachable via jsdelivr)

When in doubt, pull from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` — it mirrors most npm packages and is always safe. Examples:

```html
<!-- Plotly via jsdelivr (preferred) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/plotly.js-dist@2/plotly.min.js"></script>

<!-- D3 -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/d3@7/dist/d3.min.js"></script>

<!-- Tailwind (browser play CDN) -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@tailwindcss/browser@4"></script>
```

If a library you need is hosted only on a CDN not in this list (e.g. `cdn.example.org`), inline the library code directly — do not link to an unlisted host.

## Referencing Workspace Files

The output HTML lives three directory levels deep under `artifacts/`. To reference an image / chart / other artifact, use a **relative path with exactly three `../`** to climb out of `html/<YYYY>/<MM>/`:

```html
<!-- GOOD -->
<img src="../../../images/2026/04/foo.png">

<!-- BAD: absolute path breaks under file:// -->
<img src="/artifacts/images/2026/04/foo.png">

<!-- BAD: workspace-rooted path resolves against the page URL -->
<img src="artifacts/images/2026/04/foo.png">

<!-- BAD: runtime artifact, not a stored convention -->
<img src="/api/files/raw?path=artifacts/images/2026/04/foo.png">
```

Workspace paths returned by other tools (e.g. an image-generating tool returns `artifacts/images/2026/04/foo.png`): replace the leading `artifacts/` with `../../../`, giving `../../../images/2026/04/foo.png`.

The same rule applies to anywhere a path appears: `<img>`, `<source>`, `<video poster>`, `<audio src>`, CSS `url(...)`, etc.

## Local Images Not Already Under `artifacts/`

If you want to embed a local image that lives **outside** `artifacts/` — e.g. a file the user pasted into `data/attachments/2026/04/foo.png`, a wiki source under `data/wiki/sources/foo.png`, or any other workspace path — **do not link to it directly**. The three-`../` math only resolves cleanly for files under `artifacts/`; references that climb further or sideways break under `file://` and are fragile across workspace reorganisation.

Copy the file into `artifacts/images/<YYYY>/<MM>/` first, then reference the copy. Use `mkdir -p` for the partition directory and a UTC year/month matching the convention (`saveImage()` shards by UTC, so doing the same keeps copies grouped with same-month generated images):

```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/images/2026/04
cp data/attachments/2026/04/foo.png artifacts/images/2026/04/foo.png
```

Then in the HTML:

```html
<img src="../../../images/2026/04/foo.png">
```

Files **already** under `artifacts/` (e.g. `artifacts/images/2026/03/bar.png`, `artifacts/charts/2026/04/baz.svg`) — reference them in place; do **not** copy.

## Why Three `../`

The file is saved at `artifacts/html/<YYYY>/<MM>/<slug>-<timestamp>.html`. From that location, `../../../` climbs out of `<MM>/`, `<YYYY>/`, and `html/` to land in `artifacts/`. From `artifacts/`, the next path segment is the sibling artifact directory you want — `images/`, `charts/`, `documents/`, etc.

Absolute paths like `/artifacts/...` work in-app (the server mounts `/artifacts/images` as a static route) but break under `file://`, where root-relative URLs resolve against the filesystem root. Workspace-rooted paths without a leading slash (`artifacts/...`) get joined to the page URL by the browser and 404 every time.

## Handing a Decision Back to the Conversation

When the page is for the user to decide something — pick between mockups, settle open questions, adjust a plan — give it a button that posts the result to the host:

```html
<button id="send">Send to Claude</button>
<script>
  document.getElementById("send").onclick = () => {
    const layout = document.querySelector("input[name=layout]:checked").value;
    window.parent.postMessage({ type: "mulmo-html-submit", text: `Layout: ${layout}` }, "*");
  };
</script>
```

- `text` is plain text, at most 20,000 characters; a longer one is refused, not truncated.
- The host shows it in a confirmation bar above the page. The user can edit it, and it is sent as their next message only when they press Send — so after presenting, finish your turn instead of waiting or polling.
- Write `text` so it stands on its own: name each decision and the option chosen, not just "B".
- A page you write with `html` purely to hand decisions back may pass `submit: "direct"` to `presentHtml`: its posts then reach the conversation without the confirmation bar, as long as each one carries the key the host puts in the page's URL. A post without it, or a second one within a few seconds, still goes to the bar. It is ignored for `path` — never ask for it on a page whose script you did not write.

  ```js
  const key = new URLSearchParams(location.hash.slice(1)).get("mulmo-submit-key");
  window.parent.postMessage({ type: "mulmo-html-submit", text: summary(), key }, "*");
  ```
